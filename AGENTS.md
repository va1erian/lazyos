## Visual verification workflow

LazyOS renders to a framebuffer, so correctness is often visual. Do not claim a
graphics change works from source alone — capture and inspect real pixels.

1. **Ensure QEMU is available.** On Windows, `C:\Program Files\qemu` must be on
   `PATH`, or pass `--qemu "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe"`.

2. **Capture a screenshot** (headless; no window needed):

   ```bash
   python tools/screenshot/qemu_shot.py --out shots --at 2,5,10 --image target/lazyos.img
   ```

   Omit `--image` to boot firmware only and validate the capture pipeline.

3. **Inspect it visually.** Read the PNG in the workspace (e.g. `shots/shot_10s.png`)
   with the Read tool to actually see the rendered output.

4. **Assert programmatically** so the check is reproducible and CI-able:

   ```bash
   python tools/screenshot/pngstats.py shots/*.png --min-nonblack 0.01
   ```

   Add `--expect-width`, `--expect-height`, `--min-colors`, or `--max-mean` as needed.

5. **Run CI** for a full headless pass: `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml`
   captures, verifies, uploads artifacts, publishes to the `screenshots` branch,
   and comments images on pull requests.

See `tools/screenshot/README.md` for full options.

## Driving the guest (input injection)

To interact with LazyOS — type commands, click, scroll — script it with
`qemu_session.py` and capture the resulting pixels:

```bash
python tools/screenshot/qemu_session.py --image target/lazyos.img \
    --out shots/session --script tools/screenshot/examples/type_and_shot.json
```

Then Read the resulting `shots/session/shot_*.png`. For custom agent loops,
import `tools/screenshot/qemu_qmp.py` and call `type_text`, `press_key`,
`mouse_move`, `mouse_click`, `mouse_scroll`, `mouse_abs`, and `screenshot`.
Input is delivered via QMP `input-send-event`, so it works headless; the guest
only reacts once it has a keyboard/mouse driver (Phase 3+).

## Running the demo

Boot the interactive CLI in a window with one command:

```bash
python tools/run_demo.py
```

Type commands and press Enter: `help`, `echo <text>`, `box` (static colour
grid), `ball` (animated bouncing squares — any key stops), `bench` (renders the
scene with tiny-skia and with our own rasterizer and reports cycle counts),
`clear`, `pos`. Arrow keys move the window; Page Up/Down scroll the output;
Home/End jump.

QEMU hardware acceleration (WHPX on Windows, KVM on Linux) is auto-detected and
makes rendering several times faster than TCG; force it off with `--accel none`.
`run_demo.py` builds `target/lazyos.img` if needed (`--no-build`, `--headless`,
`-- --cpu max` are supported). For scripted visual verification, capture the
session script instead:

```bash
python tools/screenshot/qemu_session.py --image target/lazyos.img \
    --out shots/demo --script tools/screenshot/examples/cli_demo.json
```

## Project conventions

- The OS is `no_std`; target `x86_64-unknown-none`; built via the root crate's
  `build.rs` + artifact dependency (see the roadmap issues).
- Do not commit generated screenshots (`shots/` is git-ignored); CI publishes
  them to the dedicated `screenshots` branch.
- Prefer verifying with the existing scripts over ad-hoc commands so results are
  comparable across runs.

## Commands

```bash
python tools/screenshot/qemu_shot.py --out shots --at 2,5,10 --image <img>
python tools/screenshot/pngstats.py shots/*.png --min-nonblack 0.01
```
